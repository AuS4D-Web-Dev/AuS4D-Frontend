    "home.cards.development.title": "What is international development?",
    "home.cards.development.paragraph.1":
        "International development is about understanding and responding to the ways our world is changing — socially, economically, politically, culturally, and environmentally. It is concerned with human well-being, justice, and sustainability, but also recognises that “development” is a deeply debated and contested idea.",
    "home.cards.development.paragraph.2":
        "On one hand, development refers to processes of change — from shifts in economies and governance, to transformations in communities, cultures, and environments. These changes can bring progress, but they can also produce inequalities, tensions, and unintended consequences.",
    "home.cards.development.paragraph.3":
        "On the other hand, international development is also about intentional efforts to address global challenges:",

    "home.cards.development.bullet.2": "advancing human rights",
    "home.cards.development.bullet.3": "building peace",
    "home.cards.development.bullet.4": "tackling climate change",
    "home.cards.development.bullet.5": "supporting sustainable futures",
    "home.cards.development.paragraph.4":
        "These efforts involve many actors: governments, international organisations, NGOs, businesses, local communities, and individuals.",
    "home.cards.development.paragraph.5":
        "Importantly, international development raises questions of power and justice. Who decides what “progress” looks like? Whose voices are included or excluded? How can development avoid reproducing colonial legacies or creating new inequalities?",
    "home.cards.development.paragraph.6":
        "Because of these complexities, international development is both a practice and a space for critical reflection. It draws on fields such as politics, economics, anthropology, law, geography, history, gender studies, and environmental studies.",
    "home.cards.development.paragraph.7":
        "Ultimately, it is about working together across borders and scales — from the local to the global — to imagine and build fairer, more sustainable, and more inclusive futures.",

    "home.cards.changes.title": "What's changing in international development right now?",
    "home.cards.changes.intro":
        "International development is shifting in major ways. Some key changes include:",
    "home.cards.changes.bullet.1":
        "Shrinking aid budgets – Governments are cutting or redirecting funding from long-term development to short-term relief or domestic priorities.",
    "home.cards.changes.bullet.2":
        "Institutional shifts – Major agencies are being restructured, disrupting projects and raising questions about future leadership.",
    "home.cards.changes.bullet.3":
        "Geopolitics over poverty – Aid is increasingly tied to national interests like security, trade, and migration control.",
    "home.cards.changes.bullet.4":
        "Pressure on vulnerable sectors – Health, climate, and fragile states face greater challenges with less funding for long-term solutions.",
    "home.cards.changes.bullet.5":
        "New approaches – There is growing emphasis on efficiency, innovation, local leadership, and stronger partnerships.",
    "home.cards.changes.outro":
        "These shifts show how contested and political “development” really is. They also highlight why spaces like AuS4D are needed — to help students make sense of these changes, ask critical questions, and explore how to build a more just and sustainable world.",

    "home.cards.about.title": "What is AuS4D?",
    "home.cards.about.paragraph.1":
        "In the midst of global change, students are asking: What does development mean today? How can we respond to shifting priorities, power dynamics, and global challenges in just and sustainable ways?",
    "home.cards.about.paragraph.2":
        "The Australian Students for Development (AuS4D) Network was founded as a space to explore these questions. We are Australia’s first student-led network for international development and humanitarian action, connecting students and early-career practitioners across disciplines, universities, and pathways.",
    "home.cards.about.emphasis": "AuS4D exists to:",
    "home.cards.about.bullet.1":
        "Learn – engage with experts and practitioners to understand current debates and challenges.",
    "home.cards.about.bullet.2":
        "Connect – build a community committed to justice, equity, and sustainability.",
    "home.cards.about.bullet.3":
        "Collaborate – create opportunities to work together on events, projects, and ideas.",
    "home.cards.about.paragraph.3":
        "By amplifying youth voices and fostering collaboration, AuS4D gives the next generation of leaders a platform not only to join the conversation, but to help shape the future of international development.",

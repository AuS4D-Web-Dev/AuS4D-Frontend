    "home.cards.development.title": "What is International Development?",
    "home.cards.development.paragraph.1": "International development is about understanding and responding to the ways our world is changing — socially, economically, politically, culturally, and environmentally. It is concerned with human well-being, justice, and sustainability, while recognising that ‘development’ is debated and contested.",
    "home.cards.development.paragraph.2": "It refers both to broad processes of change (in economies, governance, communities and environments) and to intentional efforts to address global challenges like poverty reduction, human rights, peacebuilding, climate action and sustainable futures.",
    "home.cards.development.paragraph.3": "Questions of power and justice sit at the centre: Who decides what progress looks like? Whose voices are included? How can we avoid reproducing colonial legacies or new inequalities? It is an interdisciplinary space drawing on politics, economics, anthropology, law, geography, history, gender and environmental studies.",
    "home.cards.development.paragraph.4": "Ultimately, it is about working together across borders and scales to imagine and build fairer, more sustainable and more inclusive futures.",
    "home.cards.changes.title": "What’s changing in international development right now?",
    "home.cards.changes.bullet.1": "Shrinking aid budgets: Many governments are cutting or redirecting aid, often towards short-term relief or domestic priorities.",
    "home.cards.changes.bullet.2": "Institutional shifts: Major agencies are being restructured, disrupting projects and raising questions about future leadership.",
    "home.cards.changes.bullet.3": "Geopolitics over poverty: Aid is increasingly tied to national interests such as security, trade and migration control.",
    "home.cards.changes.bullet.4": "Pressure on vulnerable sectors: Health, climate and fragile states face funding strain, reducing long-term solutions.",
    "home.cards.changes.bullet.5": "New approaches: Emphasis on efficiency, innovation, local leadership and stronger partnerships is growing.",
    "home.cards.changes.outro": "These shifts show how contested and political development is — and why spaces like AuS4D are needed to make sense of change and explore how young people can contribute to a fairer, more sustainable world.",
    "home.cards.about.title": "What is AuS4D?",
    "home.cards.about.paragraph.1": "The Australian Students for Development (AuS4D) Network is Australia’s first student-led network for international development and humanitarian action, connecting students and early-career practitioners across disciplines, universities and career pathways.",
